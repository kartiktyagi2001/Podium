# Podium

A distraction-free space built to learn in public, write with focus, and read without noise.

---

## üöÄ Why I Built Podium?

I built Podium because I wanted a personal space to log my journey in development and document my learnings, while also applying the skills I had been picking up. At the same time, I noticed that many publishing platforms are cluttered or distracting, so I set out to solve that by building a distraction-free, markdown-enabled writing interface with a clean reading experience. On the technical side, it gave me the chance to apply what I‚Äôd learned in practice ‚Äî designing a scalable backend with Cloudflare Workers, Hono, and Prisma, along with secure authentication and role-based access.

## üõë Problem Podium is Solving

- Writing platforms often introduce friction: heavy UIs, distracting chrome, and bloated pages.  
- Developers need a simple way to write in markdown and publish with a clean, focused reading experience.  
- Personal projects need real-world scaffolding to practice production patterns: scalable runtimes, typed APIs, secure auth, and a good DX.  

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

- Distraction-free editor and a clean reading surface.  
- Fast, scalable backend on Cloudflare Workers using Hono.  
- Strongly typed data access with Prisma, plus role-based access control for safe publishing workflows.  
- Modern, lightweight frontend powered by React and TailwindCSS.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+  
- npm (suggested) or pnpm  
- PostgreSQL (local or managed)  
- Cloudflare account + Wrangler CLI  

### Clone the repository

- git clone https://github.com/your-username/podium.git
- cd podium

### Install dependencies

Using npm (recommended):

- cd backend && npm install
- cd ../frontend && npm install

### Environment Variables

Backend (.env or .jsonc(recommended)):

- DATABASE_URL=postgres://USER:PASS@HOST:PORT/DB
- JWT_SECRET=your-secret

Frontend (create a config.ts file or .env):

- export const BACKEND_URL="your backend url"

Tip: Do not commit secrets. Use Wrangler secrets for production.

### Database Setup

- cd backend
- npx prisma migrate dev
- npx prisma generate
- npx prisma studio (for database management)

### Run locally

Backend (http://localhost:8787):

- cd backend
- npm run dev

Frontend (http://localhost:5173):

- cd frontend
- npm run dev

### Build for production

Backend:

- cd backend
- npm run build

Frontend:

- cd frontend
- npm run build

## üìú Scripts

**Backend**

- build : bundle with esbuild to dist/
- dev : run Worker locally (Wrangler)
- deploy : deploy Worker (minified)
- cf-typegen : generate Cloudflare type bindings

**Frontend**

- dev : Vite dev server
- build : TypeScript build then Vite build
- preview : preview production build
- lint : ESLint

## üß© API Overview (Hono)

Sample endpoints :

- GET `/posts` ‚Üí list posts  
- GET `/posts/:id` ‚Üí fetch a post  
- POST `/posts` ‚Üí create (role-protected)  
- PUT `/posts/:id` ‚Üí update (role-protected)  
- DELETE `/posts/:id` ‚Üí delete (role-protected)  

Auth :

- role-based access via middleware. 
- JWT-based authentication for secure access.
  
Types:

- shared via `@arcbit/podium-common`.

---

## üñ• Frontend Overview

- React 18 + React Router
- Axios for API calls to the Worker  
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling  
- tsParticles for subtle visuals  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Notes

- Frontend: Tailwind wired via `@tailwindcss/vite` in `vite.config.ts`  
- Backend TS: ESNext target, JSX via Hono (`jsxImportSource: "hono/jsx"`)  
- Prisma provider: PostgreSQL (see `migration_lock.toml`)  

---

## Deployment üöÄ

**Backend (Cloudflare Workers)**  

- Configure `wrangler.jsonc` (name, account_id, routes, bindings/secrets).  
- Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy`
- Monitor: `npx wrangler tail`

**Frontend (Vercel)**

- Build: `npm run build` (after cd frontend)
- Deploy the `dist/` directory.  
  
or

- goto vercel after uploading your code to GitHub and link your account. Select your repository there and deploy.
